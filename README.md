# Chest-X-ray-Classification
Chest X-ray radiographic (CXR) imagery enables earlier and easier lung disease diagnosis. Therefore, will propose and implement a deep learning method  to classify whether the XCR image is normal or has pneumonia (a lung disease) 

# Dataset
The dataset used in this work is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia 
The Chest XRay dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val), consists 5856 of images of XRays taken. The images are classified either as healthy (Normal), or unhealthy (Pneumonia).
